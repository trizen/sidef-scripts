# Find small factors of Fermat numbers: F(k) = 2^(2^k) + 1.

# This takes advantage of the fact that the prime factors of Fermat numbers have the form:
#
#   2^(k+2) * u + 1
#
# for some integer `u`.

func fermat_small_factor(k) {

    var F = (2**(2**k) + 1)
    var t = 2**(k+2)

    for u in (2..1e4) {
        if (is_prime(t*u + 1)) {
            var z = (t*u + 1)
            if (z `divides` F) {
                return z
            }
        }
    }

    return nil

    var d = fermat_small_factor(k)
    say "2^(2^#{k}) + 1 is divisible by #{d}" if d
