# Both-trucatable primes in a given base.

# Optimization:
#   there are fewer right-truncatable primes than are left-truncatable primes, therefore we generate
#   only the right-truncatable primes and check which ones of those are also left-truncatable primes.

# Maximum value for each base is given in the following OEIS sequence:
#   https://oeis.org/A323137
